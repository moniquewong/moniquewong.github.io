# About me
I am a former management consultant who worked at McKinsey and Company based out of Vancouver, Canada. My most recent life adventure is completing the Masters of Data Science at the University of British Columbia.

I also identify with being... 

**A nerd**: I am fascinated by decision making and in my career, have seen good and poor examples of it. I believe that strong leadership and values are a part of the "good" recipe. I also believe that we, as humans, are not fully leveraging data and technology to inform our decision making. Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of data-informed decision-making by pursuing a Masters of Data Science.

**A foodie**: Beyond using my commutes as free time to research new restaurants I want to try, food is how I connected with my immigrant parents. I believe food preparation and the sharing of meals is a mechanism for social change. I believe that answers to our broken food system are answers to global challenges. This has led me to Ethiopia to understand smallholder farming. I'm excited to explore how food issues and opportunities can be a part of my future contribution to society.

**A yogi**: Level-mindedness is what I strive for and what I've observed from the leaders I most admire. I believe this equanimity is practiced and comes from a calm mind. I believe in the spiritual and physical practice of yoga and try to incorporate these practices through the fabric of my life.

**An immigrant**: I consider myself lucky and privileged. Like other 1.5 generation adult professionals, there is the culture of the professional life and there is the culture of home. As a minority in ethnicity, sexual orientation and even gender in most leadership contexts, I am too consciously aware of the unconscious biases, behaviours and systematic barriers that exist. I aspire to find language to speak truth to my experiences and I aspire to empower others who feel the same way to find their voice.

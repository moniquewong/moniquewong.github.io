I want to write about what I care about. This means curating my strong convictions, to-be-tested beliefs, pet projects and deep rabbit holes. 

Right now, the topics that interest me deeply relate to business, society, leadership and data science.

## Business
This was my first love. I remember choosing business as the first playground I wanted to learn in because of the potential to use business to shape society, ultimately improving it. This has led me to completing a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) at the University of British Columbia and kicking off my career by working at McKinsey & Company. Five years and some jobs later, I still believe in the potential of business for good but have also witnessed how business can be misused and misunderstood. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Strategy definition
- Target setting
- Business model design
- Cash management
- Pricing
- Supply and demand planning
- Entrepreneurship
- Impact reporting
- Data literate organizations


## Society
I believe that business is given a social license to operate by society and that business should benefit society. I also believe that business cannot achieve all that society needs which is where policy and civic engagement come in. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Social enterprise
- Food security
- Environmental sustainability
- Agriculture and food systems
- Social policy

## Leadership
Individuals who are independent thinkers and can bring others along with them in their mission are people who can improve society for the better. I believe leadership can happen in a variety of contexts and leaders need to adapt to each situation, meeting others where they are at. Great leaders I have worked with are humble, thoughtful and always seek to better themselves. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Decision making under uncertainty
- Spirituality and leadership
- Principles and values
- Creativity
- Communication
- Diversity and unconscious biases
- T-shaped skill building

## Data Science
I was trained as a business analyst but found the techniques and tools I used lacking. We know that data science concepts and tools have applications in the "big data" regime, uncovering patterns in vast amounts of data that you and I and our laptops cannot possible store or process. What I have come to understand through pursing a Masters in Data Science is that data science may be the most immediately applicable and accessible for business in the "small data" world, helping formalize an experimental mindset as well as in quantifying uncertainty. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Discriminatory bias perpetuated by AI / ML algorithms
- Experimental design in business
- Purpose-driven data visualization
- AI / ML for non-tech native companies
- AI / ML explainability
- Data science workflows as a part of business processes
- Data literacy as a part of organizational cultures

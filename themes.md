I want to write about what I care about. This means curating my strong convictions, to-be-tested beliefs, pet projects and deep rabbit holes. 

Right now, the topics that interest me deeply relate to business, society, leadership and data science.

## Business
This was my first love. I remember choosing business as the first discipline I wanted to hone because of the potential to use business to shape society, ultimately improving it. This has led me to completing a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) at the University of British Columbia and kicking off my career by working at McKinsey & Company. Four years and some jobs later, I still believe in the potential of business for good but have also witnessed how business can be misused and misunderstood. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Strategy definition
- Target setting
- Cash management
- Pricing
- Supply and demand planning
- Entrepreneurship
- Impact reporting
- Data literate organizations
- Business model design

## Society
I believe that business is given a social license to operate by society and that business should serve the goals of society. 

Topics I have some experience with and/or have continuing interest:
- Social enterprise
- Food security
- Environmental sustainability
- Agriculture
- Social policy

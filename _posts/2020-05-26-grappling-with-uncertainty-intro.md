## The role of data and data science in business
Over the course of my career, I have been fascinated by decision-making and how to help organizations make better decisions. This could have led to studies in psychology and leadership but I saw a gap in how businesses use data. With weeks left in my Masters of Data Science program, I want to share my thoughts on data science's role in business.

Some people are attracted to working with data because it is thought of as a source of truth that can make decision making clear and straightforward. I do not share this naive view. In fact, I believe that it's the opposite - that data can be easily manipulated to fit any story so more data often confuses the decision. So, how does data help? 

I believe that the thoughtful use of data is the best way we can approximate the truth. Data can help us narrow in on a wide world of possibilities as being possibly the truth to a nuanced view of likelihoods of different truths. Data helps *inform* our decision-making; it doesn't make a decision for us.

## Why do we care about uncertainty?
Getting this right is critical for organizations. Every business is built upon a series of decisions: where should I open shop? should I sell this product? how should I price this product? when should I order more inventory? should I hire this candidate? These decisions are consequential, not only to the success of the business but also to the wellbeing to those who work with the business.

One role that good data with thoughtful interpretation can play in decision making is to reduce uncertainty. Here, I define uncertainty as being able to identify what outcomes are *possible* but not knowing how *plausible* an outcome might be. A simple example is wanting to know the probability of a car breaking down at different future time frames after I buy it. Knowing this information between different car models will inform which car I ultimately buy.

For many of us, the gut instinct to reduce uncertainty is natural but the pursuit is often for qualitative and anecdotal data. We will scour the web for reviews for a particular car, talk to friends and family about their experiences with their car. This approach gives us some information but does not scale well to organizational decisions that are more consequential in that they affect others. For questions we care about, we should expertly combine quantitative techniques with our intuition to make our decisions.

## Demystifying uncertainty - more to come
In this series of blog posts, I will outline analytical techniques that help us gain a better understanding of uncertainty. Techniques will range from those from the business analyst toolkit of modelling scenarios to those in a data scientist's toolkit which leverages statistical techniques to estimate uncertainty. My experience is that most organizations will have already had experience with testing their decision under different scenarios to make important decisions, although sometimes sporadically. What "great" organizations do is systematically use statistical techniques to estimate uncertainty. Leaders of these "great" organizations use a better understanding of uncertainty to expertly trade off risks in order to make better-informed decisions and to be prepared for a range of outcomes. They also empower all levels of the organization to use data and its nuances to make decisions for themselves, supporting the shared mission.

As someone who started a career in management consulting first before being exposed to more rigorous analytical techniques in data science, I understand the instinct to brush off statistical techniques. I have had these beliefs before, that statistics is too rigid to be applied to the real world, that it's too complicated to explain to decision makers, that it doesn't work when there is limited data. Throughout my studies, I have found these beliefs to be unfounded, especially with simulation-based techniques that have become possible with today's computational power. Over the next several weeks, I hope to convince you of the same.
